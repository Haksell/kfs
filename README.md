# KFS

## subject

### kfs2

-   [ ] You must create a Global Descriptor Table.
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: Kernel Code
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: Kernel Data
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: Kernel stack
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: User code
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: User data
-   [ ] Your GDT must contain: User stack
-   [ ] You must declare your GDT to the BIOS.
-   [ ] The GDT must be set at address 0x00000800.
-   [ ] Shell: `pks` (print the kernel stack, in a human-friendly way)
-   [ ] Shell: `reboot` command
-   [ ] Shell: `halt` command
-   [ ] Shell: other commands for debugging purposes

### kfs3

-   [ ] You must implement a complete, stable and functionnal memory system in your kernel.
-   [ ] You must enable memory paging in your kernel
-   [ ] You must code a memory structure that handle paging and memory rights
-   [ ] You must define kernel and user space
-   [ ] You must implement a function to create / get memory pages
-   [ ] You must implement kmalloc, kfree, ksize, kbrk for physical memory
-   [ ] You must implement vmalloc, vfree, vsize, vbrk for virtual memory
-   [ ] You must handle "kernel panics" (print, stop the kernel)

### kfs4

-   [ ] Create an Interrupts Descriptor Table, fill it and register it
-   [ ] Hardware Interrupts
-   [ ] Software Interrupts
-   [ ] A signal-callback system on your Kernel API
-   [ ] An interface to schedule signals
-   [ ] Global Panic Fault handling
-   [ ] An interface to clean registers before a panic / halt
-   [ ] An interface to save the stack before a panic
-   [ ] When you’re done with all of that, you’ll have to implement a IDT keyboard handling system.
-   [ ] It has not been said, but syscalls are also handled by the IDT. You can’t implement them now (No processus / Execution), but a good start could be coding the base functions for it, it could save you some work.
-   [ ] Also, you can add some features to the keyboard handler, for example multi layouts (qwerty, azerty), base functions like get_line (just like read: waits for characters and return them when \n is pressed).

## todo

### kfs2

-   [ ] `pks` command

### kfs4

-   [ ] mouse (scroll)

### later

-   [ ] find project name and rebrand
-   [ ] finish 1st edition
-   [ ] optimize vga history with a ring buffer
-   [ ] `qemu` in terminal like lsimanic (`-display curses` with a black screen)
-   [ ] nice help menu with `Code page 437` border characters (kfs-2)
-   [ ] use KVM on top of QEMU? (idk what it means anymore)
-   [ ] specify exact nightly version
-   [ ] bring back testing and more useful stuff from https://github.com/Haksell/writing_an_os_in_rust/tree/master/v2
-   [ ] colorful tests (with color module based on `colored`)
-   [ ] install `grub-mkrescue` and all its dependencies locally
-   [ ] check the asm generated by `bootimage` in https://os.phil-opp.com/edition-2/
-   [ ] full exploration of possible deadlocks
-   [ ] find a way for rust-analyzer to analyze with both targets
-   [ ] `print_screen` creates a file using serial port
-   [ ] `insert`
-   [ ] use https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/cell/ instead of `lazy_static` crate
-   [ ] [Interrupt handlers should only perform the minimal amount of work necessary](https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/#scancode-queue)
-   [ ] warning screen (F11)
-   [ ] debug screen (F12)

## check before each push

-   set timeout=10 (and maybe several entries) for correction
-   check your work should not exceed 10 MB before push (try with release mode)
-   fix compiler warnings
